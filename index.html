        Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates
        don’t eat the tourists. Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist?
        Did he just throw my cat out of the window? You really think you can fly
        that thing? Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady!
        Drive us out of here!
      </p>

      <p>
        This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats,
        and... power windows. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God
        creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. They're using our
        own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking.
      </p>

      <p>
        I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Remind me to
        thank John for a lovely weekend. Checkmate... You know what? It is
        beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Hey, you know how I'm, like,
        always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right?
        God help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Checkmate... Yes, Yes,
        without the oops! Did he just throw my cat out of the window? So you two
        dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the
        Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists. We gotta burn
        the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the
        OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want
        it anymore! Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether
        or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.
